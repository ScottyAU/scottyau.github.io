I hope anyone reading this got some time out over the Christmas/New year period to unwind.

First off an update on the boat posted about previously.  We've had her out on the water a couple of times now and she runs great!  She hasn't skipped a beat thus far - so we're looking forward to having her our on the water a lot more for the rest of 2015.

Now that the boat is fixed I've been spending the bit of spare time I get on two bits of electronics related fun.  The first is learning to use Eagle to design PCBs.  My main resource for this is this [book](http://www.amazon.com.au/Make-Your-Own-PCBs-EAGLE-ebook/dp/B00K6L8DAW).  It's been fantastic.  I do intend to go right through to ordering some boards so when I get to that stage I'll post it here.

The other piece is [this course](http://www.pyroelectro.com/edu/fpga/).  I've completed all of the prior PyroEDU courses and think they are awesome.  If you are new to any of the subjects listed - the courses will take you through in a very hands on way with the most basic of hardware requirements.

Stay tuned - who knows what 2015 will bring.
