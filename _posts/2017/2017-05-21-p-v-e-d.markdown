For a while now I have wanted to build the P.V.E.D as designed by Alain Iamburg.  There is a [GitHub](https://github.com/alainiamburg/PVED) with everything you need to get started, and a series of [blog posts](https://www.optiv.com/blog/demystifying-hardware-security-part-i) explaining a couple of different ways you could then approach the problem.

I've had the bits needed to build one for quite a while - but finally got around to building it.

I'm thinking about maybe trying to find a half decent case and doing either this thing on perf board or maybe even having a crack at a small PCB!  Time will tell...
