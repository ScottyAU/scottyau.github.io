So one of the first things friends who already had printers told me was don't skimp on the filament - which is exactly what I did.  When I ordered the printer online I also ordered the cheapest white filament I could find online.  

I did my first 3 or 4 prints with the sample filament that came with the printer and it worked pretty well with the default bed and nozzle temps.  When it ran out I swapped it out with the filament I had bought and low and behold - it was pretty crappy.  Lots of stringing and the first layers weren't great.  I changed the temps around a bit and it got a little better - but still wasn't great.  So after chatting to the same friends and telling them they were right they recommended [3dFillies](https://3dfillies.com/).  

They shipped really quickly and came in individual resealable bags with moisture absorbing sachets.  I've done all my printing with their filament since (I got a roll of white and and a roll of black PLA+) and it's awesome.  I printed  a [tool mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4152373) and [filament guide](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2917932) in black for the printer and they both turned out great (comparison of the tool mount with the cheaper PLA I got first):

I've been told their silk filament is awesome too - so I'll try some of that at some point in the future too.
