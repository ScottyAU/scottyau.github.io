So I decided I wanted to some sort of small digital desk clock to build.  After looking around people seemed very impressed with clocks using the [DS3231](http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/4627) chip, so I googled around for clock kits using that chip and came across [this kit](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Diy-kit-ds3231-high-accuracy-infrared-remote-control-clock-mcu-led-electronic-clock/116554_1238368501.html) from Ali Express.

Looking pretty cool, being about the right size with the right chips and with some SMD components for me to practice soldering I ordered one and went to sit by the mail box.

The kit did take several weeks to show up - but this was over Christmas - so i'm not sure if it was slow shipping or just that time of year.

The kit itself arrived well packed but appeared to be missing one thing.  There were no build instructions or documentation anywhere to be found.  I emailed the seller thinking maybe they just don't bother printing them and would just email them through.  There was a bit of a language barrier with the seller, but after a few emails he sent me some zip files.

Opening these up it appeared like he'd zipped up the documentation for a world of electronic kits.  Schematics, code, data sheets - all sorts of stuff.  I had a good look through everything I had, but could see anything that matched exactly the kit I had in my hot little hands.  I did notice some logos/urls for other blogs and shops online selling other kits - but I couldn't find any blog posts or kits matching the one I bought.

In steps my good mate to the rescue!  I sent him the zip files and he had a look through them.  Through a bit of detective work (and a huge amount of experience) he came to the conclusion that the design for the kit I had was based off this [VFD clock](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_55988b010100t4p9.html) (you'll need google translate).

With that in mind I packed up the kit and headed over to his place to have a crack at putting the kit together the below schematic as a guide:
