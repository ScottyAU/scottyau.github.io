So the last post left off here:

Just like the thermostats housing before it, there were a couple of issues.  The bolt holding the lower anode in snapped when I tried to remove it.  The irony there is that it didn't need to come out to remove the lower section of the outboard.  There were also a couple more serviceable parts that needed to be replaced once I had the lower section off, which meant waiting a week or two for more parts to arrive.  Add to that a crazy couple of weeks at work and this past weekend was the first chance I had to get Dusty back together.  When the lower section came off a few weeks ago, it looked like this:

First thing was to clean it all up.  There was a lot of sand and gunk in there, the seals on the exhaust adapter between the lower and upper section of the outboard had melted away and I needed to get that snapped bolt out to replace the rear anode (the anode was now loose and would have made a fair bit of noise vibrating around).  I took to the entire lower section with a mixture of a wire brush on a cordless drill, and a wire brush on my Dremel for some of the trickier bits.  I also cleaned up the exhaust adapter that goes between the lower and upper section of the outboard.  I don't have a shot of it before, but it was pretty bad.  Here it is cleaned up with new seals ready to go:

Once that was done I drilled out the bolt for the rear anode an installed the new one:

Next step was to rebuild the water pump.  The pump kit came with instructions which were pretty straight forward.  Nice shiny new parts:

Once that was all together and assembled on the lower section, it was ready to go back on:

This was actually quite tricky by myself (it's got a bit of weight to it).  It took me a few goes to get it all lined up, but once it was it just slotted straight into place.  I did up all the bolts and stood back to admire my greasy fingerprints:

Only thing left to do was to turn it over.  It started pretty well, with a much stronger stream of water coming from the tell tale.  A great sign the the new pump was pushing the full amount of water through.  I let it run for a good 15 minutes and could feel when the thermostats opened and hot water started to cycle through.  It ran the entire time without any cooling system issues that I could see.  Next step is to change the oil in the gear case (since its the last serviceable item I haven't done) and put Dusty back in the water for a test trip.  Finger crossed that all the maintenance for the season done.  She needs a good clean to remove all those greasy fingerprints.  I've also thought about getting a replacement decal set from eBay, but i'll wait on any cosmetic bits and pieces until I know I've worked out all the mechanical issues.
