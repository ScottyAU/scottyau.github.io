So I'm the type that has alway dabbled in electronics - but I don't do it for a living.  Thankfully one of my best mates is a seasoned engineer, and is always willing to give me a hand or answer any questions I have.  This blog is just intended as a place for me to write down some notes as I build/learn what the heck I'm doing.

The first series of posts are going to be about me building a small clock kit that I recently purchased, and the ongoing experiences of getting it working.
