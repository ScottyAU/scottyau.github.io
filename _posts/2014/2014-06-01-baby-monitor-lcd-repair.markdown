Pretty quick post about my morning repairing the baby monitor that we were given for our new born last week.  It's an Angelcare AC401 (sensor pads not pictured):

It's only issue was the LCD display.  It started out just missing a segment or two when our friends were still using it, and slowly progressed until the display was almost useless:

We were gifted the monitor, as our friends kids are past that age - which saved us a chunk of $$ on a new one.  So I set about opening it up to see what sort of connection the LCD display was using to see if I could reseat/reconnect it to get the LCD working 100% again:

Once it was apart the cable to the LCD was clearly visible, and was just one of those glued ribbon cables.  The best link I could find about repairing one of these is from [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Repair-a-Malfunctioning-LCD/).  I followed that, using a peg to hold the display where I needed it while working on it:

I got out my heat gun and put it on the lowest setting and gave the ribbon a few hits, waiting a few minutes in between.  I figured a few hits at lower heat were a better starting point that one go with a higher heat.  I used a pencil with an eraser on the end as pictured in the Instructables guide to apply pressure to the cable as it was heated and the glue melted.  I put it back together enough to power it up:

So there you go, about 20 minutes of my time and no new parts later we have a baby monitor that works 100%.  Time to go change another nappy!
