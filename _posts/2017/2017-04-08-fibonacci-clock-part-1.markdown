I was lucky enough to be gifted a [Fibonacci Clock kit](https://basbrun.glopal.com/en-AU/p-38/fibonacci-clock-full-kit.html) towards the end of last year (Thank You!) - but thanks to #life have only just got to assembly this weekend.

The kit itself is AMAZING in terms of quality.  From the quality of the PCB design including silk screen, to the quality of the electronic components, the build guide, and finally the plywood case supplied.  Initially I thought it might have been the cheaper kits I have built previously - but no this one is just that good.  The following is just a series of photos from building the electronic side.  All through hole stuff.  Well laid out with amazing instructions.  Will turn my attention now to the enclosure.  Pretty slick looking I think:
